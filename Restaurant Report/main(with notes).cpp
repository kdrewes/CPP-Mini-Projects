/**
 Write a program to help a restaurant owner keep track of how many pounds of food each category of diners eats each day during a typical week. There are 3 categories of diners: Kids, Adults and Seniors.
 Do not use global variables, pointers or vectors for this program.
In main create a two-dimensional 3 x 7 array to hold the dinersâ€™ data. Each row represents a different diner category and each column represents a different day of the week.
From main call a function to prompt and capture the user input data for each diner category. Validate the input, negative numbers for pounds of food eaten is invalid.
From main call a function to calculate and display the average amount of food eaten per day by all the diners.
From main call a function to display the least amount of food eaten during the week by any one diner category (Display the Diner Category, the least amount of food eaten, and on what day).
From main call a function to display the greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one diner category. (Display the Diner Category #, the greatest amount of food eaten, and on what day).
Run:
Input Data
Amounts of food (in pounds) eaten each day of the week by each category of diners
Kids: 200, 100, 100, 60, 75, 300, 300
Adults: 500, 300, 200, 200, 400, 600, 900
Seniors: 400, 500, 600, 600, 700, 200, 100
